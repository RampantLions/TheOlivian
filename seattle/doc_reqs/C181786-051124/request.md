*Describe the specific records:*
> I am writing to request access to and copies of all public records under the Washington State Public Records Act, RCW 42.56. Please include all available records related to The Olivian located at 809 Olive Way, Seattle, WA 98101, managed by Greystar. Requested Records: All Hearings and Decisions: Any hearings, decisions, or proceedings involving The Olivian that the Seattle Hearing Examiner has held or been involved with in the last four years. If this request is deemed too broad, please limit the records to the last two years. Complaints and Charges: Copies of any complaints, charges, or formal accusations filed against The Olivian or its management (specifically Greystar) related to violations of Seattle municipal codes, housing codes, or other regulations within the last four years. If necessary, please limit this to the last two years. Responses from The Olivian or Greystar: Any responses, official communications, or submissions from The Olivian or Greystar to the Seattle Hearing Examiner, including defenses, explanations, or other correspondences in relation to the complaints or charges within the same time frame. Billing and Charging Practices: Any records, communications, reports, or documentation that detail or discuss the billing and charging practices of The Olivian or Greystar, especially those related to utility charges, property fees, or tenant billing practices within the last four years. Again, if the request is too broad, please adjust to the last two years. Communications with The Olivian or Greystar: All correspondences, emails, letters, notes from meetings, and any other form of communication between the Seattle Hearing Examinerâ€™s office and representatives of The Olivian or Greystar regarding any issue within the scope of this request from the last four years, or two years if needed to narrow the scope. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50. However, if possible, I would appreciate it if you would waive any fees as the disclosure of this information is in the public interest, providing transparency in the activities of a property management company that has significant impacts on Seattle residents. If my request is too broad or does not sufficiently describe the records, please contact me so that I can clarify my request, and when necessary, I will be happy to narrow the scope of my request to expedite the process. Thank you for considering my request.
